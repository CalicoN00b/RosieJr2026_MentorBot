# RosieJr2026_MentorBot

This is a "fork" of [RosieJr2026](https://github.com/jmchs-robotics/RosieJr2026/), from the students of FRC 5933.

This made made for two reasons:

1) I needed to get code out of my head.
2) I can now use this code to help guide the team, as I have a better understanding of how stuff works now.
